  Regular blogger, sometimes aspiring author. By day, I'm a Software Developer at <a href="https://alertlabs.com/pages/zachary-jacobi">Alert Labs</a>. By night I write things. Both of these look the exact same to an outside observer, because it's just me sitting in front of a computer screen, hitting buttons.

  This blog is mostly written from an empirically minded centre-left position, with special emphasis on the role that genuine trade-offs play in political theory. If you're interested in the top level political views that shape how I write, you can look at my yearly political views posts, collected under the "<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tag/my-biases/">My Biases</a>" tag.
