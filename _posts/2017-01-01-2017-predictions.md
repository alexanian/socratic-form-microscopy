In the vein of <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/12/31/2016-predictions-calibration-results/">Slate Star Codex</a>, I'd like to publicly post my predictions for 2017. I've tried to tie these predictions to empirically verifiable outcomes as much as possible, so that there's no room for interpretation or wiggling. I've also included my confidence in my predictions (all predictions are formulated so confidence is at least 50%) so that I can check my calibration as well as my accuracy. If you can think of a better formulation of any of these that maintains the meaning, please let me know before January 7th. I will not edit this post at all after then, even to correct typos.
