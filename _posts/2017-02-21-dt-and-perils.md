In light of the leaks about Michael Flynn, just about everyone, from America's allies to its intelligence officers, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/white-house-leaks-russia-michael-flynn-intelligence-five-eyes-1.3985073">seems to be reconsidering how much intelligence they share</a> with Donald Trump's White House. I can't think of anything more damaging to President Trump's ability to govern than various domestic and allied agencies (semi-)publicly mulling whether or not to share information with him.

It's not that I think this will cause irreparable damage to his public image. At this point, you can be swayed by other people's opinion of Trump or you can't. Trump's base doesn't care what a bunch of intelligence geeks in suits think about him. They just want to see jobs come back.

It's just that Trump is already beginning to experience one of the most significant failure modes of single-person rule: isolation.

One of the little talked about virtues of democracy is how its decentralizing tendency makes isolation of key decision makes much more difficult. Take Canada as an example. There are 338 Members of Parliament, each based in a different geographic region and expected to regularly travel there and respond to the concerns of the local residents. Each MP also has several aides, responsible for briefing them and keeping them in the loop. Cabinet Ministers have all of this, plus they'll have one or two MPs acting as <em>their</em> assistants in matters of their portfolio. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is accountable to his constituents, his cabinet, his MPs, and through them, all of Canada.

It is very difficult to influence Mr. Trudeau's decision making by influencing the information he receives. Government agencies can attempt it, but Mr. Trudeau is broadly popular, which makes this much more difficult. To hide information from a leader, you need a quorum. While this can be accomplished by a vocal minority, it becomes very difficult to gather even this in the face of enthusiastic majority support.

In addition, the diverse information channels Mr. Trudeau has access to mean that he is very likely to hear about any notable news that leaks out a department, even if his chief of staff or one of his cabinet ministers doesn't want him to.

This has the effect of making power struggles somewhat transparent. In general, power among the elites is apportioned based on the results of elections and measured in terms of Members of Parliament and political capital (or, more concretely, opinion polling and what this means for re-election chances). All of this information is a matter of public record. Anyone who wants to know what elite faction is currently dominant and how much political capital it has left can find this out with a simple Google search.

On the other end of the spectrum, we have the Vatican. Pope Francis was elected through an opaque process and few Catholics saw his election coming. The power games of the cardinals are hidden from most congregants and their reasons for voting how they do are between them and their god. Francis will reign until he dies or steps down, but the power games of the elites (read: the cardinals) haven't stopped. Instead of jockeying for position directly, they will jockey by trying to control the flow of information to Francis. If one group of cardinals succeeds (or even partially succeeds), they will wield significant invisible influence.

This same sort of opacity is what makes the "science" of <a href="http://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/08/18/why-we-need-kremlinology-again/">Kremlinology</a> appealing. Without clear information, it takes a hundred subtle hints to figure out who has power (and perhaps even more critically, who is being listened to by those with power).

Right now, it seems like Donald Trump is in a situation that is closer to the Pope than the Prime Minister of Canada.

This normally isn't the case for presidents. They're deeply embedded in the fabric of a party and have multiple channels for information â€“ as well as multiple factions they depend on for support. Trump lacks both history and (in his mind, at least) dependency. The route of last resort for information to travel to the president is through donors. Trump has closed off this route by believing he's entirely self-made.

All of this means that Trump is at serious risk of being controlled by one or two influential advisors. If this happens, there really are limited options for his party to bring him back in line and coordinate on a legislative agenda if the interests of those advisors don't align with the interests of the Republican party.

This is what should be keeping congressional Republicans up at night. Trump should be staying up at night wondering about what his agencies are refusing to tell him.

Governments have to rely on veritable armies of analysts to keep them swimming in the data they need to act. You want to launch an airstrike on a suspected terrorist? You're going to need a dozen people to correlate a hundred small tidbits of information to positively identify them with enough time to spare to launch a cruise missile or a drone.

These people tend not to be <em>that</em> loyal to any particular party (at least when it comes to how they do their job). While the heads of departments are often political appointees, their deputies are career men and women who have come up through the civil service. Whatever they lack in loyalty to parties, they make up for in loyalty to the system. This is generally enough to allay any fears about them hiding information or failing to perform their role.

Enter Donald Trump, who seems like he might just try and rip the whole system down around their ears. Do you think they're going to stand for that? If you can't believe that they have conviction and a genuine loyalty to the system, at least believe that they have some instinct for self-preservation. Career civil servants rely on the system for a paycheck, after all.

Imagine you're an intelligence officer, fairly high up. You know how much of a threat Russia is. You've been watching them for a decade and you've seen how they're gobbling up territory along their borders, trying to reclaim some slice of their lost empire. You think Trump is going to give some of the intelligence you just collected to Russia, blowing the cover of a source or two. So, you hide it. It's easy enough to do. All you really have to do is flag it as routine, not pass it up the chain of command. It's almost the same as phoning it in, really.

Imagine you are Trump. Intelligence is drying up. What do you do? You can go yell at your CIA Department head (who might be loyal to you). He or she can go yell at some subordinates. And they'll promise to do better. They might, for a week or two, or they might not. Maybe you start getting more intelligence, but it's all of terrible quality.

What do you do? What can you do?

In the end, Trump is one man. He has maybe a hundred people who are personally loyal to him. If we're generous, we might call it 150. But I think we have to cap it at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number">Dunbar's number</a>. He can't count on an unbroken chain of personal loyalty either, because there is a disconnect between the career civil servants and the political appointees.

Trump and all of his henchmen can rant and rail all they want. But at the end of the day, they can't compel. They can't hold guns to the heads of every CIA analyst and demand they tell the administration everything they know. They can't even fire them all. You can't solve an intelligence shortage by getting rid of all your intelligence analysts. At a certain point, you just have to give up.

Think I'm exaggerating? Think this couldn't possibly work on Trump? Read Eichmann in Jerusalem and <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/01/30/book-review-eichmann-in-jerusalem/">you'll learn it worked on the Nazis</a>. Where open resistance failed, obstructionism and carefully cultivated laziness succeeded.

Power is in many ways an illusion and a fragile one at that. Break it and you might not be able to put it back together. If Trump threatens the CIA (or any other agency; you can also image the DoJ taking forever to close an investigation or the EPA having a bunch of trouble finishing an inspection and giving an all clear) and fails to deliver on his threat (likely), then the jig is up. He's lost all ability to change anyone's behaviour through threats.

So, this is the problem Trump faces. He has the presidency and he intends to use it to make sweeping changes to America. But without close cooperation with lawmakers, his term is going to look a lot like an attempt at one-man rule. Certainly, this should be frightening for everyone who cares about checks and balances in America.

But it should also frighten Trump's supporters. One man rule is a terrible system of government. If Trump makes a serious go at it, his cabinet and advisors will be at each other's throats (when he isn't around) in next to no time and he'll face persistent (but impossible to end) resistance from almost every Federal department. I don't know how exactly Trump plans to make America great again, but I bet he isn't prepared for large scale passive resistance.

The final remaining question then is: will this resistance show up, or are the early rumours exaggerated. On this point, the world is watching and hoping that the ordinary civil servants of America display the requisite moral courage to passively resist Trump's most damaging requests.
