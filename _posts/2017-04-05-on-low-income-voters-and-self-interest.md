<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/americans-voting-for-cuts-1.4055389">Neil McDonald's new column</a> points out that Trump's low-income supporters voted against their own economic self-interest. This presents a fine opportunity for Mr. McDonald to lecture those voters about how bad Trump's policies will be for them, as if they couldn't have figured it out themselves.

I say: some of Trump's supporters voted against their own self-interest? So what? Hillary Clinton's well-off supporters, from Sam Altman, to many of my friends in the Bay Area did as well.

Back in Canada, I have even more examples of people who voted against their self-interest. They include myself, Mr. McDonald (in all likelihood), a bevy of well off technologists and programmers, and a bunch of highly educated students who expect to start high-paying jobs before the next election.

Just like Trump's lower-income voters, we knew what we were getting into. We understood that we were voting for higher taxes for people like us. We voted for higher taxes because we like the things taxes buy – infrastructure, social services, and science funding, to name a few.

I have no doubt Mr. McDonald would understand this. But when it comes to low-income voters putting their aspirations for their country above their self-interest, he's flabbergasted.

<blockquote>Americans are raised to believe that anything is possible in America if you are pure of heart and willing to work hard, which is nonsense, and that anyone can become president, which is even more foolish, and that free markets always make the right decision, which is nuts.

They are told that rugged individualism is the American way, which it isn't, and that government is never the solution, which it sometimes most definitely is.</blockquote>
Mr. McDonald forgot to wonder if the people voting for Trump might desperately want these things to be true. What if the people he's talking about really wanted everything he listed to be true and saw voting for Trump as their best chance to make them reality? What if they understood what they might lose and chose to vote anyway? Why should he believe they're less likely to evaluate the consequence of a vote than he is? If any of these are true, are these voters still sheep led astray by right-wing politicians? Or are the politicians just responding to a real demand from their constituents?

These are the sorts of questions I'd like to see journalists who want to write about people – especially low-income people – voting against their economic self-interest grapple with.

It's certainly unlikely that Mr. Trump will be able to deliver everything his supporters hope he will or everything he's promised. That makes him a liar, or more charitably, overambitious. It doesn't make his followers worthy of scorn for the simple act of voting for the type of society they wanted.

I would like to note that I view many of Trump's policies as wrong-headed and profoundly lacking in compassion. I have no objections to someone scorning Trump voters because those voters seem to prefer fear to compassion and division to equity. I simply object to the hypocrisy of journalists mocking low-income Republicans for the same actions for which they lionize well-off Democrats (replace with Conservatives and Liberals if you're in Canada and it still holds).

Why should people vote for their economic self-interest anyway? Sure, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/04/29/yes-money-really-can-buy-happiness/?utm_term=.c1d553e75fb2">studies show that money totally can buy happiness</a>, but it's not the only thing that can. You can also become happy by living in a place that embodies your values. What left-wing think pieces criticizing the poor for voting against their interests miss is that this is true no matter how much money you make.

Here's one theory of political consensus: if everyone votes for the policies that will be most to their own economic benefit, we'll end up with compromise policies that tend to economically benefit everyone reasonably well. Here's a different take: if everyone votes for the type of country they want to live in, we'll end up with a country that fits everyone's preferences reasonably well.

If you look at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html?_r=0">exit poll data</a>, it looks like people are pursuing a mix of these two strategies. Hillary Clinton won among people making less than $50,000 per year and Donald Trump won among people making more. While this may look like people are mainly voting in their economic interest, all of these margins were remarkably thin and notably much smaller than they were in the last election cycle. This could be indicative of more and more people voting aspirationally, rather than economically.

One interesting tidbit for Mr. McDonald though – if you look at the exit poll data, it turns out low income voters are the ones least likely to vote against their own self-interest.
