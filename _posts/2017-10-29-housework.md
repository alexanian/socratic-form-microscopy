<em>Note: This blog post is about housework and chores. If disability or mental illness makes chores difficult for you to do and having someone breezily describe it as "easy" will be bad for you, I recommend skipping it. This meant to help people who are able split chores with a partner – but historically haven't – begin to do so. It isn't meant to be a cudgel with which to beat people who have difficulty with chores due to ability status. If this describes you, you are not lazy or broken and your difficulties are real and valid.</em>

So, you've seen the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/26/gender-wars-household-chores-comic">comic by Emma</a>, or read <a href="https://socratic-form-microscopy.com/2017/09/17/book-review-the-second-shift/">The Second Shift</a> (which also happens to be my favourite term for the chores and childcare that happens after or before work), or maybe someone has linked you here with a pointed note. In any case, I'm going to assume you're reading this because you've realized that you don't help your partner with much around the house, don't share much of the management of household chores with your partner, or aren't very good at household chores and want to get better.

There are three main things you need to work on if you want to be able to split both the act of doing chores and the mental load of keeping track of them with your partner[^1]. These are: general skills, noticing things, and keeping track of what needs to happen. It's difficult to work on any of these in isolation. Getting better at chores will help you feel empowered to notice when they need to be done or keep track of the schedule of doing them. Doing chores whenever you notice they need to be done will give you the practice you need to get better at them.

I think it would be a confusing guide if I laid it all out as holistically as you'll be working on everything. In the interest of making this digestible, I've given each of the key areas their own subsection, with an additional final section the talks about dealing with some of the issues that may arise as you and your partner negotiate and re-negotiate the second shift.

<h3>General Skills</h3>
If you honestly don't have any housework skills at all (either because you lacked an adult to model them for you, or adults refused to model them for you because of your gender, or any other reason) you're going to need to start by building them up. It may seem like a good idea to ask your partner for help with this task.

It <em>might</em> not be. If your partner is frustrated with you because they feel you aren't pulling your weight around the house, asking them to teach you will only increase the short-term stress on them. You'll probably expect them to respond really positively to your change of heart, but you shouldn't be surprised if they're instead grumbly. Teaching someone how to do something is <em>work</em>. Teaching you chores would mean that for a while, all chores will take them longer.

It's possible that your expectation that your partner be thrilled that you're helping out will clash with any annoyance they have at doing chores more slowly in order to teach you and leave both of you feeling out of sorts. You'll be hurt that your partner isn't appreciating your "gift"[^2], while your partner might feel like it's taken you long too long to even offer. It's also possible that seeing you learn might convince your partner that you can't do chores correctly, which will make them reluctant to delegate chores to you and ruin your whole enterprise before it really begins.

If it turns out your partner is a bad choice, cadge lessons from your closest friends. They don't have to live with you and they aren't starting from a place of frustration. For many friends, it's definitely worth a few pointers to have someone else do the grunt-work of their chores for them. And that's exactly the deal I suggest you make.

That said, if your relationship with your partner is one where you can talk honestly and openly (and if it isn't, um, what are you doing?) you can cut out the guessing and just <em>ask them</em> what they'd prefer. Talking with your partner has a further advantage: you can ask them what chores they'd most like you to learn. I have some samples here, but if these are the chores your partner minds least (while I know at least one person who hates each of these, they also <em>just happen</em> to be the chores I find most tolerable), you may want to substitute them for chores your partner especially hates (like <em>fucking sweeping</em>, the objectively worst chore).

<h4>Cooking</h4>
Think about the type of food you (and your friends or your partner) like to eat, then go looking online for recipes that match. I'm very partial to the <a href="http://www.presidentschoice.ca/en_CA/recipes.html">President's Choice recipes website</a>, as well as the blog <a href="https://cookieandkate.com/2013/west-african-peanut-soup/">Cookie and Kate</a>, but Google is your friend here. Once you have a recipe in mind, contact your chosen teacher and ask if you can buy the ingredients[^3] and make it for them. Make it clear that the meal will only happen if they teach you things like basic knife skills and how to boil water.

Repeat this process with several different friends until you can make 2-3 recipes unaided. Ideally these shouldn't have much overlap in technique (e.g. one soup, one stir fry with rice, and one pasta dish). Once you have the basics under your belt, you should be able to pick the rest up as you go along, assuming you end up doing at least some of the cooking in your household.

<h4>Doing Dishes</h4>
There are four good reasons to learn to do the dishes:
<ol>
 	<li>It's easy to learn and hard to get wrong</li>
 	<li>It's an excellent way to train your ability to <em>notice things</em></li>
 	<li>Doing the dishes doesn't preclude talking with people</li>
 	<li>Which means that you can get a reputation as helpful simply by doing the dishes whenever someone invites you over for a meal, without sacrificing any time hanging out with your friends</li>
</ol>
You can learn to do the dishes the same way as cooking. Just ask a friend if you can come over, hangout, and do their dishes. Basically no one will say no to this. It can also be combined with learning to make food if you want to save some time.

Whenever you do dishes at home, especially if it's part of your set of chores, you should remember that the dishes aren't truly done until you've put them away. Don't leave them in the dishwasher or drying rack for days!

<h4>Laundry</h4>
Laundry is a chore that has to be scheduled (unless you like running out of underwear), so learning it will allow you to practice that aspect of the second shift. You can learn laundry the same as you would dishes or cooking, or maybe even at the same time if are picking recipes with lots of dead time.

There are two important things to note about laundry:

<ol>
 	<li>If you don't want everything to be horribly wrinkled, you need to take it out of the dryer as soon as it's done.</li>
 	<li>If you are doing laundry for someone else (and especially if that person wears feminine clothes), you <em>must</em> ask them "is there anything in this load that can't go in the dryer or needs to go in on delicate?". Many things (especially hosiery) can be ruined by the wrong dryer setting, or by going in the dryer at all.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Cleaning the washroom</h4>
I've found that people give me an inordinate amount of credit (relative to the work involved) whenever I clean a washroom. I think this is because (oddly) most people hate cleaning the washroom. These people are mistaken. In all households where the washroom has been cleaned in the last year or so, this is one of the least gross rooms to clean.

(That said, this is one chore I <em>wouldn't </em>recommend learning at the same time as you cook!)

People are very cavalier about food. Food spills rarely get cleaned up properly, leading to stickiness or mold in the kitchen. Kitchen sinks are often a disaster of old food, soggy vegetables, and clogged drains. I find it impossible to clean a kitchen without retching at least once from some food that's gone off.

Bathrooms, on the other hand, rarely smell all that bad (and when they do, it's more of a faint lingering odour, as opposed to the concentrated wretchedness you might find at the back of the fridge). People are incredibly embarrassed by any <em>spills</em> they cause in the bathroom and try to completely clean them up. If you wear gloves and wash your hands regularly, you should rarely be grossed out cleaning the bathroom (with the exception of the shower drain, which becomes a yawning abyss as soon as anyone in the house has hair past shoulder length).

Most people (especially people in their twenties) don't realize all this and treat cleaning the bathroom as only marginally less heroic than cleaning up nuclear waste.

Take advantage of this fact and offer to clean your friend's washroom if they show how to do it. You really only need to do this once or twice to get the hang of it. Then you'll be all set to take over what's probably your partner's least favourite chore.

<h4>Once you've learned some things</h4>
You can show off your skills to your partner. If you started learning before your inability to do chores became a problem in the relationship, you were probably having your partner teach you, in which case you can skip this step. If you instead learned from friends, you need to make your partner aware that you can now do things around the home.

Ideally, you would clean a room or make a dinner and then have your partner make non-judgemental suggestions about how you could do it better. Be prepared to spot genuine conflicts of values; you might view things as clean after a quick wipe, when your partner considers them clean only after a thorough scrub. I suggest that you and your partner put some time into negotiating a combined standard if your preferences aren't already congruent. Remember that if you haven't been doing the chores much, you aren't really negotiating from a position of <em>strength</em>. Also remember that diverging cleanliness preferences aren't really a good reason to go back to doing nothing.

Within a month or so of starting your journey towards chores competence, you should be ready to take stuff off your partner's plate. Note that the chores I've outlined above don't represent half the housework for a typical couple (unless you do a significant amount of yard work or take over all of the cooking), so you'll probably have to learn a few more things. Once you've built up goodwill from actually doing some chores, it should be fine to have your partner teach you how to do the remaining ones.

I actually recommend learning how to do every chore that gets regularly done. This allows you to do it if your partner is gone or sick (or if you ever break up). It also helps you discover which chores you don't mind and which you despise (I'm looking at you, cleaning the kitchen). It's probably best to split up the housework such that you and your partner spend a similar amount of time on the chores you don't mind, in addition to trying to balance the overall amount of work.

<h3>Noticing Things</h3>
Being able to do some chores means you've graduated from Chores 101. In Chores 202, you should develop the ability to do chores without prompting. It's one thing to clean the washroom when asked, or make dinner when your partner loudly declares "I'm hungry". It's quite another to say to your partner "hey, I think this is as messy as I ever want the bathroom to get, will it disrupt your routine if I clean it tonight?" or "hey dear, does <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/cauliflower-mac-and-cheese-casserole-recipe-2013849">cauliflower mac and cheese</a> sound good for dinner at six?" and then <em>follow through</em>.

When you take ownership of a chore and <em>follow through</em> on it, your partner can begin to drop the chore from their mind. Instead of looking around the washroom every so often, thinking about when they need to tell you to clean it, they can enjoy their shits in peace; instead of reminding you to go grocery shopping as a subtle way of telling you it's your night to cook, they can relax and assume you'll cook something delicious.

To build up your ability to notice things, you should pick a handful of chores and internally declare them <strong>MY RESPONSIBILITY</strong>. For chores that are your responsibility, you are forbidden to think "somebody should do that". Whenever this thought happens, replace it with "<strong><em>I</em></strong> should do that!".

With dishes this is especially easy. Look at the sink whenever you're in the kitchen. If you don't have anything urgent to do and there are some dishes in the sink, immediately do them (this is especially useful while waiting for the microwave, coffee maker, or toaster). On nights when your partner is cooking, head into the kitchen midway through their meal prep and start doing any dishes they're done with. If you time this right, almost all the dishes can be done by the time you start eating and you can keep your partner company to boot[^4].

You should aim to never be asked about something that is your responsibility (outside of extenuating circumstances, like "finals week").

It's obviously unfair to expect one person to notice everything wrong with the house (especially if people in the house have different cleanliness preferences). Note that this applies to your partner just as much as it applies to you. <em>Neither of you</em> should have to notice everything! This probably requires you and your partner to talk about what <em>wrong</em> means to you and come to a clear consensus. You should judge the state of the house off of this consensus, not off of how it feels to you personally[^5].

There's one final step to noticing things. When your partner asks you to do something (like get out a specific dish from the dishwasher), notice what else could be done and assume that the ask was as expansive as possible. Don't just get out a single dish. Empty the whole dishwasher. When asked to take the laundry out of the dryer, fold it and put it away too. When you do the bare minimum, you push all the rest of the work onto your partner.

<h3>Keeping Track of What Needs to Happen</h3>
This is the last thing you need to get good at if you really want to share the mental load of chores with your partner.

Almost all chores spawn meta-chores. Cooking provides a simple example; you can't cook if you don't pay the power bill, buy groceries, and keep your cooking surfaces relatively clean. Even less involved chores probably require the occasional shopping trip, while children spawn a truly staggering amount of secondary work (like doctor's appointments, vaccinations, permission slips, pre-school applications, birthday party invitations to sort, and homework to look over).

You can't truly have ownership of a chore without taking responsibility for the chores it spawns. If your partner has to ask you every week if they need to pick up more cleaning supplies at the store, you've done a poor job managing the meta-chores. Your partner can only really banish a chore from their head once you've shown a clear track record of managing the meta-chores too.

If your memory isn't great, assistive technology can really help. Apparently virtual assistants are now good enough that saying "Okay Google, remind me to buy dryer sheets next time I'm at a store" actually works. If you don't want to share everything you ever do with Google or Apple, a pen and paper or notes to yourself on a calendar can work just as well.

You don't need to do everything here yourself. If your partner regularly shops or is on their way to the grocery store for something they need, it's totally fine to ask them to grab something you need on the way. The thing you want to avoid is the sort of cascading failure (e.g. a lack of soap means that laundry isn't done for two weeks) that promotes chores they thought would be safely done to the top of their attention.

Ultimately, responsibility for your chores means that you should be able to do it even if no one else comes and saves you. In the same way that you want to train yourself to replace "someone should do that" with "I should do that" for the physical act of the chore, you need to replace things like "someone should buy more soap" with "I need to make sure we get more soap".

<h3>Problems Sharing the Second Shift</h3>
I got the idea to write this after a friend shared Emma's comic on their Facebook wall. Seeing the sense of hopelessness or anxiety it gave people who hadn't been raised to know how to do chores or recognize when they had to be done was very eye-opening for me. One common complaint among people unused to chores was that it would be very stressful for them to try and notice every time something wasn't perfect in order to swoop in and fix it.

I think this is a very reasonable thing to worry about <em>if</em> you and your partner are incapable of talking about things like "what does good enough look like?" and "how can we split these up, so that neither of us has to constantly ensure absolutely everything is perfect?". In mainstream society, there's a tendency for couples <em>not</em> to talk about their preferences and instead believe that true love necessarily provides intuition into everything your partner could want.

This becomes a real disaster when everyone assumes that their own way of doing things is the only reasonable way people would want to do it. In this case, genuinely different standards end up being misinterpreted as incompetence or subtle resistance.

All this is to say: if you're worried that you can't do anything to your partner's nebulous standards, the root cause of this problem might be<em> that you have no clue what those standards are and don't know how to talk about them</em>, not that noticing things is inherently very stressful[^6]. You should also make sure that you haven't just ignored ten years of requests to do things to a certain standard, maybe because it was more convenient for you to ignore them?

I will say that if it feels impossible or very stressful to try and keep track of everything, this should be taken as evidence of how your partner might feel about it too. Foisting all that work onto them is a step of last resort that should only be undertaken after you've talked with them and made sure it isn't just as costly for them to do all the management as it would be for you to do it.

Once you've overcome (or renegotiated) the stressful aspects of the second shift and taken on your share of it, it's pretty natural to expect your partner to express a lot of gratitude. This may not necessarily happen or may not happen right away, especially if it's taken you a very long time to start caring. "What took them so long?" is probably a more realistic response than "my hero!".

If you feel underpraised, stop and consider how often <em>you</em> praise your partner for doing housework. If you already do, that's awesome. Tell them that while this isn't a quid pro quo, you'd be more motivated to do chores if they praised you too. If you don't praise them, perhaps ye should give as ye expect to receive? Positive reinforcement probably will help you continue to do chores, but you and your partner may have to work through some lingering feelings before they're quite willing to take that final step.

[^1]: Or partner<strong>s</strong>. Or roommates. Or family. Endlessly caveating for all potential relationships that can occur in shared spaces is inimical to good flow and I'm vain enough about my writing that I'm going to sacrifice some nuance in the name of readability.
[^2]: For more about how the "economy of gratitude" can intersect with chores, see pages 54, 147, and 308 of The Second Shift by Professor Arlie Russel Hochschild (<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/310593/the-second-shift-by-arlie-hochschild/9780143120339/">eBook version</a>).
[^3]: Make sure to do the grocery shopping yourself, as grocery shopping is a skill all on its own. You haven't fully appreciated just how taxing it can be until you've found yourself in the produce aisle, futilely scanning for an obscure vegetable and frantically Googling things like "can you use green onions instead of shallots?" or "what is the difference between scallions and shallots?". (Learning to cook was full of onion related trauma for me)
[^4]: There is a big difference between your partner doing a chore while you relax and do other things and your partner doing a chore while you keep them company and help them with little things. If there are chores you are genuinely hopeless at that you still want to be a part of, you can help your partner out by making their life less boring and providing some company. Even people who can't boil water without burning down the kitchen can fetch things from the fridge.
[^5]: It's deeply unfair for people to be held to standards that they don't know about. Having a clear conversation about chore expectations allows you and your partner to avoid the feeling that you're being judged by capricious and mysterious standards.
[^6]: I am a bona fide expert at stressing out over little things and found a ten-minute conversation codifying the implicit assumptions my partner and I had around chores eliminated basically all of the stress I had. I now know that they find disorder much more stressful than lack of cleanliness and really appreciate me keeping things organized (I'm the opposite, so gave little thought to order), while they now know my esophageal problems make it very hard for me to eat food that is weirdly prepared (my partner is a very proficient cook with an iron gut, which sometimes leads to culinary experiments that are a bit beyond my ability to choke down; I stick to recipes).<br />Still, if this is very stressful for you even after a conversation, there is nothing wrong or broken about you! Be prepared to challenge your assumption that this will necessarily be stressful, but if your assumption is borne out, you should probably try something else. Maybe you can compensate for not managing the chores in other ways (perhaps by doing more of the actual work of chores)? I think splitting all aspects of chores evenly is a useful default, but each partnership needs to figure out for themselves what feels fair and achievable to them!
