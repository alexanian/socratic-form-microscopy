<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>I originally worried that I'd missed the mark with my Venezuelan devaluation predictions (<strong>South America #2</strong>), as DolarToday gave an exchange rate of 730.29 BsS. to the dollar. But it turns out the BsS. is a new currency, with each one equivalent to 100,000 of the old bolivars. This means the current exchange rate is 73,029,000 old bolivars to the USD. Inflation was 4305%. It is now an unfortunate fact that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/08/world/world-of-warcraft-token-worth-more-than-venezuelas-currency-trnd/index.html">some online video game currencies are worth more than the old Venezuelan bolivar</a>.</li>
 	<li>For <strong>Middle East #3</strong>, I got conflicting information from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embassy_of_the_United_States,_Jerusalem">Wikipedia</a> as to whether the embassy was officially moved, or just moved in name pending the ambassador finding a place to live in Jerusalem. I decided that it should count as moved for all practical purposes.</li>
 	<li>With respect to <strong>Middle East #15</strong>, I believe that the US withdrawing from the P5+1 deal and restarting sanctions should probably count as new sanctions.</li>
 	<li>I think <strong>Africa #8</strong> is technically correct, because Zuma wasn't impeached, but forced out by his party. Still, I think I will aim to make broader predictions about embattled leaders leaving in the future.</li>
 	<li>I calculate Japan's inflation rate at around 1.05% <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/japan/inflation-cpi">based off the most recent statistics I could find</a>, although this may need to be adjusted once December's numbers are out and further adjusted once we have the year-end numbers. I got <strong>Asia #1 </strong>wrong, but not by much!</li>
 	<li>I was worried that no member of the standing committee had visited North Korea, potentially making <strong>Asia #10</strong> a technical success, despite it obviously being falsified in spirit (by the three meetings in <em>China</em> by Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-un). Luckily, Li Zhanshu, a Standing Committee member, visited to commemorate the founding of North Korea.</li>
 	<li>I'm a bit unsure how I should treat <strong>Europe #10</strong>; the UK negotiated a Brexit deal, but no one actually believes in can pass parliament. I'm going to tentatively mark this as correct, but will revise if parliament passes this deal unaltered.</li>
 	<li><strong>EDITED TO ADD:</strong> I originally didn't mark <strong>America #6</strong> as failed because I totally forgot about the one day government shutdown in January. I've since updated everything to add this in.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Calibration</h2>
The whole point of having predictions with binned probabilities (here, 51%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%) is that you can then check your accuracy; an individual prediction can be right or wrong, but when you pool several predictions you were equally sure of, you can tell if you were right or wrong to be that sure. Here's how I did:
<ul>
 	<li>Of my predictions at a <strong>51%</strong>confidence level, I got <strong>6 </strong>right and <strong>6</strong> wrong (<strong>50%</strong>).</li>
 	<li>Of my predictions at a <strong>60%</strong>confidence level, I got <strong>4</strong> right and <b>7</b> wrong (36<strong>%</strong>).</li>
 	<li>Of my predictions at a <strong>70%</strong>confidence level, I got <strong>13</strong> right and <strong>5</strong> wrong (<strong>72%</strong>).</li>
 	<li>Of my predictions at an <strong>80%</strong>confidence level, I got <strong>19</strong> right and <strong>5</strong> wrong (<strong>79%</strong>).</li>
 	<li>Of my predictions at a <strong>90%</strong>confidence level, I got <strong>23</strong> right and <strong>2</strong> wrong (<strong>92%</strong>).</li>
 	<li>Two predictions were invalid, because they were predicated on a North Korean missile test that never occurred.</li>
</ul>
Some people prefer to look at this graphically. Here I've plotted my answers versus what you'd expect if I was perfectly calibrated (something I say is 70% likely to happen happens 70% of the time). Whenever the blue line labelled "Mine" is below the red line labelled "Perfect", I was overconfident. Whenever it's above the red line, I was under-confident.

Like last year, I'm pleased with these results. Most of my probability bins were very well calibrated, although I seem to have become rather overconfident at the 60% level. I was under-confident at that level last year by a significant amount, so this might just be normal variance. I'll keep an eye on this for next year.

In terms of specific classes of failed predictions, I can identify two.

First, I tend to overestimate how quickly bureaucratic processes will finish (see: <strong>3</strong>, <strong>5</strong>, <strong>23</strong>). Second, I tend to assume the future will look much like the present (see: <strong>11</strong>, <strong>29</strong>, <strong>72</strong>, <strong>74-79</strong>). This might be because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic">availability heuristic</a>; the present is more available than alternative futures, so I might be viewing it as more likely than I should.

I hope to account for these biases in my soon to be released predictions for 2019. Stay tuned!
