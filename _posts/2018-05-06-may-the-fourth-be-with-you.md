(The following is the text of the prepared puns I delivered at the 30th <a href="https://worldwidepuns.com/">Bay AreaÂ pun off</a>. If you're ever in the Bay for one, I really recommend it. They have the nicest crowd in the world.)

First: May the Fourth be with you ("and also with you" is how you respond if like me, you grew up Catholic). As you might be able to tell from this shirt, I am <em>religiously</em> devoted to Star Wars. I know a lot about Star Wars, but I'm more of an <strong>orthodox</strong> fan- I was all about the Expanded Universe, not this reverend-ing stream of Disney sequels.

They might be popepular, but it seems like all Disney wants is to turn a <strong>prophet</strong> - just get big <strong>fatwa</strong>s of cash. They don't care about <strong>Allah</strong> the history that happened in the books. Just <strong>mo-hamme(r)</strong>ed out scripts with flashy set piece battles full of <strong>Mecca</strong> and characters we <strong>med-in-a</strong> earlier film.

The EU was mostly books and I loved them despite their ridiculousness. Like, in terms of plots, it's not clear the writers always <strong>card'in-al</strong>l the books; they often <strong>passover</strong> normal options and have someone kidnap Han and Leia's kids.

There were so many <strong>convert</strong>-sations between the two of them, like "do you <strong>noah</strong>f <strong>ark</strong> 'ids are fine" immediately interrupted by formulaic videos from the kids: "Don't worry about m<strong>i-mam</strong> it's alright, this dude who kidnapped us is a total <strong>Luther</strong> who just wants to <strong>Hindu</strong>-s you to vote another way in the Senate". Eventually they figured out a <strong>wafer</strong> Leia to <strong>communion</strong>-cate that the kids needed a <strong>body</strong>-<strong>god</strong>. This led them to <strong>Sikh</strong> out Winter, who came with the recommendation: "no kidnapper will ever get <strong>pastor</strong>".

What else? Luke trains under a clone of Emperor <strong>Pulpit</strong>-een. Leia is like, "<strong>bish, op</strong>en your eyes, dude's dark" but Luke justifies it with "well, there's some things <strong>vatican</strong> teach me".
Eventually after Leia asks "how could you <strong>Judas</strong> to us", Luke snaps out of it and decides he's having <strong>nun</strong> of Palpatine's evil deeds. He <strong>con-vent</strong> his anger somewhere else. He comes back to the light side and everyone's pretty willing to ex-<strong>schism</strong> for everything he did.
Anyway, I'm really sad that the books aren't canon anymore. I know there are a lot of <strong>ram, a dan</strong>ting number, but I hope I have <strong>Eid</strong>ed you in appreciating them.
