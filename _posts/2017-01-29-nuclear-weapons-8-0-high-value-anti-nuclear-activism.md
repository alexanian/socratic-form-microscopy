Nuclear weapons represent an existential risk. I'll let <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/nuclear-security/">80,000 Hours</a> speak for me for a minute:

<blockquote>A survey of academics at the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference by Oxford University estimated a 1% chance of human extinction from nuclear wars over the 21st Century.
<em>…</em>
Luke Oman estimates the probability “for the global human population of zero resulting from the 150 Tg of black carbon scenario in our 2007 paper [delving into the effects of a single nuclear exchange] would be in the range of 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 100,000.” This being said, we think this estimate is too low, as it doesn’t account for the potential for weaknesses in their model or the risk of a societal collapse causing a permanent reduction in humanity’s ability to reach its potential (which is nonetheless an existential risk even if people remain).</blockquote>
If you're interested in reducing the existential risk that nuclear weapons pose, I've identified a few areas where you may be able to make a difference.
<h3 id="1">8.1 Tactical Weapons</h3>
Countries have begun to reduce stockpiles of tactical weapons and put those that remain under better centralized control. No one ever wanted a fresh lieutenant in charge of the nuclear weapon that could eventually set off World War III – it just took everyone a while to realize this.

Still, it seems like this has primarily been possible because of the collapse of the Soviet Union. When the USSR seemed poised to overrun Europe, killing the commies was given priority over keeping humanity alive. Increasing regional tensions between Russia and NATO may result in a resurgence of tactical weapons.

Treaties that ban weapons under a certain yield, or require all nuclear warheads to have locks that can only be released by the civilian leadership of a country would be an excellent way to reduce the risk of conventional warfare leading to a nuclear exchange.

<h3 id="2">8.2 Arms Reduction Treaties</h3>
Not all arms reduction treaties are created equal. The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (SORT) expired on the same day it came into full effect and set non-specific limits; while it may have reduced the total number of nuclear weapons deployed, it probably did this by causing the early retirement of already obsolescent systems. In addition, SORT had no verification provisions. We literally have no way of knowing if it actually had an effect.

On the other hand, the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) has a robust verification mechanism, including demonstrations that technology has been fully decommissioned and eighteen inspector visits each year. New START sets specific limits on ICBMs, SLBMs, nuclear armed bombers, and total deployed warheads. It will be in full force for at least three years, but might be extended longer. It comes up for review in 2019, so convincing the US and Russia to renew it will be very important.

<h3 id="3">8.3 Anti-ballistic missiles</h3>
The US ABM system represents a real threat to global peace. If it is demonstrated to be effective, we could see China rapidly increase its nuclear arsenal. If it's expanded to the East Coast of the US, or Europe, we could see Russia do the same.

If you live in America, pressuring your congressional representative or senator to vote against any measures increasing funding for the ABM system could be very important. You can call it a waste of taxpayer money, demand it not be built in your backyard, etc.

If you live near one of the current ABM sites, or are near one of the sites for potential expansion, you can engage in direct action.

In addition to organizing protests (it should be easy to get people uneasy about nuclear weapons near them), you can attempt to bog down any expansion or new construction in and endless morass of red tape. If a system is being built near you, you should attend any community meeting you can, be as obstinate as possible, and jump on any zoning violation, rushed environmental assessment, or other bureaucratic mistake like a rabid pit bull. This won't be very effective if new ABM sites are built entirely within existing military bases, but if even a single support strut has to go up for municipal approval, there's potential to make an impact.

Current ABM sites are Fort Greely in Alaska and Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. Proposed eastern sites are SERE Remote Training Site in Maine, Fort Drum in New York, Camp Ravenna Joint Military Training Center in Ohio, and Fort Custer Training Center in Michigan.

<h3 id="4">8.4 Donations</h3>
Both <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/nuclear-security/">80,000 Hours</a> and <a href="http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/nuclear-weapons-policy#Our_focus_on_nuclear_war">OpenPhil</a> have done their own preliminary assessment of nuclear weapon risk.

Neither piece offers firm suggestions for the most effective charity and I lack the expertise to do my own evaluation. Both OpenPhil and 80,000 Hours suggest that there may not be much room for more funding, although OpenPhil suggests that effective anti-nuclear advocacy may be underfunded.

For what it's worth, I'm donating to the <a href="http://www.ploughshares.org/">Ploughshares Fund</a>. They seem to have the correct focuses, from <a href="http://www.ploughshares.org/issues-analysis/early-warning/iran-deal-luxury-trump-can%E2%80%99t-afford-lose">preserving the Iran deal</a>, to <a href="http://www.ploughshares.org/issues-analysis/article/bring-home-us-tactical-nuclear-weapons-europe">removing tactical weapons from Europe</a>, to <a href="http://www.ploughshares.org/issues-analysis/article/press-pause-missile-defense-europe">opposing new ABM systems</a>. I don't think they have that much more room for funding, so I'd welcome a more thorough effectiveness evaluation that would allow people concerned with nuclear risk to confidently donate their money.
