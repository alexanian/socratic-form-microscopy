Back in February, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2017/02/05/on-norms/">I predicted</a> that the slew of scandals Trudeau was facing wouldn't decrease his approval ratings. To put numbers on this, I gave my confidence intervals for Trudeau's approval ratings in April.

Thanks to the "<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/leadermeter/index.html">Leader Meter</a>", it's easy for me to check up on how Trudeau is doing. As of right now, the most recent poll has him at 48% approval (this is conveniently the first poll since April 1st, making it useful for the purposes of checking my prediction), while Éric Grenier's model has him at 50.6% approval.

Both of these are within all three probability intervals I offered. In addition, Trudeau was polling higher in March than he was in February, further evidence that the scandals in February (and the abandonment of electoral reform) haven't hurt his popularity.

I continue to believe that the erosion of political norms around scandals during Steven Harper's time in office has played a large role in Trudeau's enduring popularity.
