Inspired by <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/02/2017-predictions-calibration-results/">Slate Star Codex</a>, this is my second year of making predictions (see also: my <a href="https://socratic-form-microscopy.com/2017/01/01/2017-predictions/">previous predictions</a>, <a href="https://socratic-form-microscopy.com/2018/01/01/grading-my-2017-predictions/">their scores</a>, and <a href="https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/ijwJnK9fCKqQWRhLL/my-predictions-for-2018-and-a-template-for-yours">my recent LessWrong post about these predictions</a>).

Before I jump into the predictions, I want to mention that I've created templates so that anyone who wants to can also take a stab at it; the templates focus on international events and come in two versions:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0kvgpby3smprqgy/2018%20Predictions%20Blank.docx?dl=0">Long</a> (which assumes you read global news a lot)</li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/l796riojfbvus1j/2018%20Predictions%20Short%20Blank.docx?dl=0">Short</a> (which is less demanding)</li>
</ul>
With both these sheets, the idea is to pick a limited number of probabilities (I recommend 51%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90%) and assign one to each item that you have an opinion on. At the end of the year, you count the number of correct items in each probability bin and use that to see how close you were to ideal. This gives you an answer to the important question: "when I say something is 80% likely to happen, how likely, really, is it to happen?"

You can also make your own (<a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/01/06/predictions-for-2017/">or use the set of questions Slate Star Codex normally uses</a>). If you do make your own, please link your post (and maybe also your template?) in the comments or post it to the front page. It's my hope that this post can serve as a convenient place for the LW community to look at the predictions of everyone who wants to participate in this experiment!

With that out of the way, here's my guesses for the next year.
