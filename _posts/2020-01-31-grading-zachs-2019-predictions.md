<h2><b>Notes</b></h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Zach was confidently wrong that Canadian courts wouldn’t rule on assisted dying (<b>Canada #6</b>) and carbon taxes (<b>Canada #7</b>). This may have been an over-correction from their incorrect <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2019/01/01/grading-my-2018-predictions/">2018</a> prediction that the courts <i>would</i> rule on assisted dying.</li>
 	<li><b>America #7 </b>is false with the provided definition of credible; most news outlets identified 13 major democratic candidates at the start of 2020, but Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer have never held elected office.</li>
 	<li>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/aptivs-self-driving-bmws-have-made-more-than-50000-rides-on-the-lyft-app-in-las-vegas/">Lyft/Aptive pilot</a> in Las Vegas, NV clearly counts as an “open, commercial self-driving car service” (<b>America #16</b>) but is a free-to-ride service funded by a subsidized city contract (the  <a href="http://www.theshorthorn.com/news/arlington-expands-drive-ai-autonomous-vehicle-transportation-program/article_be3333ba-5279-11e9-827c-87f271fafb00.html">Drive.ai pilot</a> in Arlington, TX) “commercial”? Is a service available only to pre-screened, though regular, users (the <a href="https://www.uber.com/us/en/atg/cities/">Uber pilot</a> in Pittsburgh, PA) “open”? I decided the the TX and PA services could round to a metro area.</li>
 	<li>I went back and forth on whether protests resulted in more than 100 fatalities in Venezuela (<b>South America #5</b>). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Venezuelan_protests">Wikipedia</a> says 107+, but its sources for that number are all from before <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24788&amp;LangID=E">the OHCHR report</a> of 66 deaths from January to May. In July, Human Rights Watch <a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2020/country-chapters/venezuela">reported</a> thousands of extrajudicial killings, but those don’t seem linked directly to protests, and I don’t know if they count as “official”. I decided that there were <i>probably </i>more than 100 fatalities.</li>
 	<li>The South Sudan peace deal (<b>Africa #1</b>) hasn’t been explicitly abandoned, but it has been <a href="https://apnews.com/c1a0e20e434643948431ef4cfee5386e">violated</a>. I decided it still “holds”, in that both sides are still trying to keep the peace.</li>
 	<li>Botswana’s Transparency International rating (<b>Africa #7</b>) didn’t get worse under Masisi, it’s just still 61.</li>
 	<li>I think Thailand’s elections <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47620749">don’t qualify as a return to democracy</a> (<b>Asia #9</b>) given that the military was able to appoint the senate and the senate voted in the leader of the 2014 coup as prime minister.</li>
 	<li>Although Julian Assange is no longer hiding in the Ecuadorian embassy, there are ongoing extradition hearings, so I wouldn’t call the situation (<b>Europe #11</b>) resolved.</li>
 	<li>I decided the intent of “beat top humans” in <b>Europe #16</b> is fulfilled by AlphaStar <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaStar-Grandmaster-level-in-StarCraft-II-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning">playing at the Grandmaster level</a> with all three StarCraft II races, though it being better than 99.8% of Battle.net players still means it has no high-profile defeats of individual top humans.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Calibration</b></h2>
The whole point of having predictions with binned probabilities (here, 51%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%) is that you can then check your accuracy; an individual prediction can be right or wrong, but when you pool several predictions you were equally sure of, you can tell if you were right or wrong to be that sure. Here’s how Zach did:
<ul>
 	<li>Of predictions at a <b>51%</b> confidence level, I marked <b>5</b> right and <b>10</b> wrong (33%).</li>
 	<li>Of predictions at a <b>60%</b> confidence level, I marked <b>11</b> right and <b>5</b> wrong (69%).</li>
 	<li>Of predictions at a <b>70%</b> confidence level, I marked <b>11</b> right and <b>4</b> wrong (<b>73%</b>).</li>
 	<li>Of predictions at an <b>80%</b> confidence level, I marked <b>21</b> right and <b>3</b> wrong (87%).</li>
 	<li>Of predictions at a <b>90%</b> confidence level, I marked <b>23</b> and <b>2</b> wrong (<b>92%</b>).</li>
</ul>
Represented graphically (along with previous years) this looks like:

<img class="alignnone wp-image-1024 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019predictions-1.gif" alt="Line graph comparing the percentage of correct predictions to perfect calibration. An animation contrasts 2019 scores with 2017 and 2018 scores." width="600" height="371" />

The worsened calibration for 2019 is likely a reflection of the fact that Zach didn’t grade these predictions. My best interpretation of the predictions (and of the available evidence) is almost certainly less accurate than Zach’s would have been.

<h2><b>A Final Note</b></h2>
You may wonder why I graded these predictions. I am sorry to say that Zach could not; they passed away suddenly last August. (You can read <a href="https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/brantford-on/zachary-jacobi-8815357">the obituary</a> here, if you’d like.) I wish, with all the sharp vehemence of recent grief, that I could still eavesdrop as Zach honed their beliefs about the world. I hope my years of doing so will inspire me to cultivate truer (and better-calibrated) beliefs on my own.
