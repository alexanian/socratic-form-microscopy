<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1917510971?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1">I just finished Pump Six</a>, a collection of short stories by <a href="http://windupstories.com/">Paolo Bacigalupi</a>. A few weeks prior to this, I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1858807711?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1">Ted Chiang's short story collection, Stories of Your Life and Others</a> and I couldn't help but be struck by the contrast between them. Ted Chiang writes stories about different ways the world could work. Paolo Bacigalupi writes stories about different ways the future could happen.

These are two very different sorts of speculation. The first requires extreme attention to detail in order to make the setting plausible, but once you clear that bar, you can get away with anything. Ted Chiang is clearly a master at this. I couldn't find any inconsistencies to pick at in any of his stories.

When you try to predict the future – especially the near future – you don't need to make up a world out of whole cloth. Here it's best to start with plausible near future events and let those give your timeline a momentum, carrying you to where you want to go on a chain of reason. No link has to be perfect, but each link has to be plausible. If any of them leave your readers scratching their heads, then you've lost them.

Predicting the future is also vulnerable to the future <em>happening</em>. Predictions are rooted in their age and tend to tell us more about the context in which they were made than about the future.

I think Pump Six is a book where we can clearly see and examine both of these problems.

First, let's talk about chains of events. The stories <em>The Fluted Girl</em>, <em>The Calorie Man</em>, <em>The Tamarisk Hunter</em>, and <em>Yellow Card Man</em> all hinge on events that probably seem plausible to Bacigalupi, but that feel deeply implausible to me.

<em>The Fluted Girl</em> imagines the revival of feudalism in America. Fiefs govern the inland mountains, while there is a democracy (presumably capitalist) on the coasts. This arrangement felt unstable and unrealistic to me.

Feudal societies tend to have much less economic growth than democracies (see <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/10/20/the-anti-reactionary-faq/">part 2 of Scott's anti-reactionary FAQ</a>). Democracies also aren't exactly great at staying calm about atrocities right on their doorsteps. These two facts combined make me wonder why the (Coloradan?) feudal society in <em>The Fluted Girl</em> hasn't been smashed by its economically (and therefore, inevitably militarily) more powerful neighbours.

In <em>The Tamarisk Hunter</em>, the Colorado River is slowly being covered by a giant concrete straw, a project that has been going on for a while and requires massive amounts of resources. The goal is to protect the now diminished Colorado River from evaporation as it winds its way into a deeply drought-stricken California.

In the face of a bad enough drought, every bit counts. But there are much more cost effective ways to get your drinking water. The Colorado river today has an average discharge of 640m<sup>3</sup>/s. In a bad drought, this would be lower. Let's say it's at something like 200m<sup>3</sup>/s.

You could get that amount of water from building about 100 desalination plants, which would cost something like $100 billion today (<a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/2014/05/29/nations-largest-ocean-desalination-plant-goes-up-near-san-diego-future-of-the-california-coast/">using a recently built plant in California as a baseline</a>). Bridges cost something like $3,000 per m<sup>2</sup> (using this <a href="http://www.bv.transports.gouv.qc.ca/mono/0950935.pdf">admittedly flawed report</a> for guidance), so using bridges to estimate the cost, the "straw" would cost about $300 million per kilometer (using the <a href="https://www.gcex.com/grand-canyon-trivia/">average width of the Colorado river</a>). Given the relative costs of the two options, it is cheaper to replace the whole river (assuming reduced flow from the drought) with desalination plants than it is to build even 330km (&lt;200 miles) of straw.

A realistic response to a decades long California drought would involve paying farmers not to use water, initiating water conservation measures, and building desalination plants. It wouldn't look like violent conflict over water rights up and down the whole Colorado River.

In <em>The Calorie Man</em> and <em>Yellow Card Man</em>, bioengineered plagues have ravaged the world and oil production has declined to the point where the main source of energy is once again the sun (via agriculture). Even assuming peak oil will happen (more on that in a minute), there will always be nuclear power. Nuclear power plants currently provide for only ten percent of the world's energy needs, but there's absolutely no good reason they couldn't meet basically all of them (especially if combined with solar, hydro, wind, and if necessary, coal).

With improved uranium enrichment techniques and better energy storage technology, it's plausible that sustainable energy sources could, if necessary, entirely displace oil, <a href="https://www.tesla.com/">even in the transportation industry</a>.

The only way to get from "we're out of oil" to "I guess it's back to agriculture as our main source of energy" is if you forget about (or don't even consider) nuclear power.

This is why I think the stories in Pump Six tell me a lot more about Bacigalupi than about the future. I can tell that he cares deeply about the planet, is skeptical of modern capitalism, and fearful of the damage industrialization, fossil fuels, and global warming may yet bring.

But the story that drove home his message for me wasn't any of the "ecotastrophes", where humans are brought to the brink of destruction by our mistreatment of the planet. It was <em>The People of Sand and Slag</em> that made me stop and wonder. It asks us to consider what we'd lose if we poison the planet while adapting to the damage. Is it okay if beaches are left littered with oil and barbed wire if these no longer pose us any threat?

I wish more of the stories had been like that, instead of infected with the myopia that causes environmentalists to forget about the existence of nuclear power (when they aren't attacking it) and critics of capitalism to assume that corporations will always do the evil thing, with no regard to the economics of the situation.

Disregard for economics and a changing world intersect when Bacigalupi talks about peak oil. Peak oil was in vogue among environmentalists in the 2000s as oil prices rose and rose, but it was never taken seriously by the oil industry. As per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_oil">Wikipedia</a>, peak oil (as talked about by environmentalists in the '00s, not as originally formulated) ignored the effects of price on supply and demand, especially in regard to unconventional oil, like the bitumen in the Albertan Oil Sands.

Price is really important when it comes to supply. Allow me to quote from <a href="https://priceonomics.com/how-the-hunt-brothers-cornered-the-silver-market/">one of my favourite economics stories</a>. It's about a pair of Texan brothers who (maybe) tried to corner the global market for silver and in the process made silver so unaffordable that Tiffany's ran an advertisement denouncing them in the third page of the New York Times. The problems the Texans ran into as silver prices rose are relevant here:

<blockquote>But as the high prices persisted, new silver began to come out of the woodwork.

“In the U.S., people rifled their dresser drawers and sofa cushions to find dimes and quarters with silver content and had them melted down,” says Pirrong, from the University of Houston. “Silver is a classic part of a bride’s trousseau in India, and when prices got high, women sold silver out of their trousseaus.”

Unfortunately for the Hunts, all this new supply had a predictable effect. Rather than close out their contracts, short sellers suddenly found it was easier to get their hands on new supplies of silver and deliver.

“The main factor that has caused corners to fail [throughout history] is that the manipulator has underestimated how much will be delivered to him if he succeeds [at] raising the price to artificial levels”</blockquote>
By the same token, many people underestimated the amount of oil that would come out of the woodwork if oil prices remained high – arguably artificially high, no thanks to OPEC – for a prolonged period. As an aside, it's also likely that we underestimate the amount of unconventional water that could be found if prices ever seriously spiked, another argument against the world in <em>The Tamarisk Hunter</em>.

This isn't to say that there won't be a peak in oil production. The very real danger posed by global warming and the fruits of investments in alternative energy when oil prices were high will slowly wean us off of oil. This formulation of peak oil is much different than the other one. <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/ihs-iea-electric-autonomous-ride-hailing-1.3983818">A steady decrease in demand for oil</a>  will be hard on oil producing regions, but it won't come as a sharp shock to the whole world economic order.

I don't know how much of this could have been known in 2005, especially to anyone deeply embedded in the environmentalist movement. As an exoneration, that's wonderful. But this is exactly my point from above. You can try and predict the future, but you can only predict from your flawed vantage point. In retrospect, it is often easier to triangulate the vantage point than to see the imagined future as plausible.

Another example: almost all science fiction before the late 00s drastically underestimated the current prevalence in mobile devices. In series that straddle the divide, you often see mobile devices mentioned much more in the latter books, as authors adjust their visions of the future to take into account what they now know in the present.

Writing is hard and the critic will always have an easier time than the author. I don't mean to be so hard on Bacigalupi, I really did enjoy Pump Six and it's caused me to do no end of thinking and discussing since I finished reading it. In this regard, it was an immensely successful book.
