No, this isn't a post about very pretty houses or positional goods. It's about the type of beauty contest described by John Maynard Keynes.

Imagine a newspaper that publishes one hundred pictures of strapping young men. It asks everyone to send in the names of the five that they think are most attractive. They offer a prize: if your selection matches the five men most often appearing in everyone else's selections, you'll win $500.

You could just do what the newspaper asked and send in the names of those men that you think are especially good looking. But that's not very likely to give you the win. Everyone's tastes are different and the people you find attractive might not be very attractive to anyone else. If you're playing the game a bit smarter, you'll instead pick the five people that you think have the broadest appeal.

You could go even deeper and realize that many other people will be trying to win and so will also be trying to pick the most broadly appealing people. Therefore, you should pick people that you think most people will view as broadly appealing (which differs from picking broadly appealing people if you know something about what most people find attractive that isn't widely known). This can go on indefinitely (although Yudkowsky's Law of Ultrafinite Recursion states that "<a href="https://archive.is/NUr0z#selection-995.76-995.141">In practice, infinite recursions are at most three levels deep</a>", which gives me a convenient excuse to stop before this devolves into "I know you know I know that you know that…" ad infinitum).

This thought experiment was relevant to an economist because many assets work like this. Take gold: its value cannot to be fully explained by its prettiness or industrial usefulness; some of its value comes from the belief that someone else will want it in the future and be willing to pay more for it than they would a similarly useful or pretty metal. For whatever reason, we have a collective delusion that gold is especially valuable. Because this delusion is collective <em>enough</em>, it almost stops being a delusion. The delusion <em>gives</em> gold some of its value.

When it comes to houses, beauty contests are especially relevant in Toronto and Vancouver. Faced with many years of steadily rising house prices, people are willing to pay a lot for a house because they believe that they can unload it on someone else in a few years or decades for even more.

When talking about highly speculative assets (like Bitcoin), it's easy to point out the limited intrinsic value they hold. Bitcoin is an <a href="https://www.bullionstar.com/blogs/bullionstar/bitcoin-isnt-digital-gold-its-digital-uselesstainium/">almost pure Keynesian Beauty Contest asset</a>, with most of its price coming from an expectation that someone else will want it at a comparable or better price in the future. Houses are obviously fairly intrinsically valuable, especially in very desirable cities. But the fact that they hold some intrinsic value cannot by itself prove that none of their value comes from beliefs about how much they can be unloaded for in the future – see again gold, which has value both as an article of commerce and as a beauty contest asset.

There's obviously an element of self-fulfilling prophecy here, with steadily increasing house prices needed to sustain this myth. Unfortunately, the housing market seems especially vulnerable to this sort of collective mania, because <a href="https://www.bauer.uh.edu/yerramilli/RatnadiwakaraYerramilli.pdf">the sunk cost fallacy makes many people unwilling to sell their houses at a price below what they paid for it</a>. Any softening of the market removes sellers, which immediately drives up prices again. Only a massive liquidation event, like we saw in 2007-2009 can push enough supply into the market to make prices truly fall.

But this isn't <em>just</em> a self-fulfilling prophecy. There's deliberateness here as well. To some extent, public policy is used to guarantee that house prices continue to rise. NIMBY residents and their allies in city councils deliberately stall projects that might affect property values. <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/buho/buho_008.cfm">Governments provide</a> tax credits or access to tax-advantaged savings accounts for homes. In America, mortgage payments provide a tax credit!

All of these programs ultimately make housing more expensive wherever supply cannot expand to meet the artificially increased demand – which basically describes any dense urban centre. Therefore, these home buying programs fail to accomplish their goal of making house more affordable, but do serve to guarantee that housing prices will continue to go up. Ultimately, they really just represent a transfer of wealth from taxpayers generally to those specific people who own homes.

Unfortunately, programs like this are very sticky. Once people buy into the collective delusion that home prices must always go up, they're willing to heavily leverage themselves to buy a home. Any dip in the price of homes can wipe out the value of this asset, making it worth less than the money owed on it. Since this tends to make voters very angry (and also lead to many people with no money) governments of all stripes are very motivated to avoid it.

This might imply that the smart thing is to buy into the collective notion that home prices always go up. There are so many people invested in this belief at all levels of society (banks, governments, and citizens) that it can feel like home prices are too important to fall.

Which would be entirely convincing, except, I'm pretty sure people believed that in 2007 and we all know how that ended. Unfortunately, it looks like there's no safe answer here. Maybe the collective mania will abate and home prices will stop being buoyed ever upwards. Or maybe they won't and the prices we currently see in Toronto and Vancouver will be reckoned cheap in twenty years.

Better zoning laws can help make houses cheaper. But it really isn't just zoning. The beauty contest is an important aspect of the current unaffordability.
