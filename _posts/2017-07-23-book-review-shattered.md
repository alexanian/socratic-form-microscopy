<em>[10 minute read]</em>

<em>Foreword: November 8<sup>th</sup> was one of the worst nights of my life, in a way that might have bled through – just a bit, mind you – into this review. My position will probably mellow as the memories of my fear and disappointment fade. </em>

My latest non-fiction read was <em>Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton's Doomed Campaign</em>. In addition to making me consider a career in political consultancy, it gave me a welcome insight into some of the <em>fascinating</em> choices the Clinton campaign made during the election.

I really do believe this book was going to rip on the campaign no matter the outcome. Had Clinton won, the thesis would have been "the race was closer than it needed to be", not "Clinton's campaign was brilliant".

Despite that, I should give the classic disclaimer: I could be wrong about the authors; it's entirely possible that they'd have extolled the brilliance of Clinton had she won. It's also true that Clinton almost won and if she had, she would have captured the presidency in an extremely cost-effective way.

But almost only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades and an election is neither. Clinton lost. The <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-comey-letter-probably-cost-clinton-the-election/">11<sup>th</sup> hour letter from Comey to congress</a> and Russian hacking may have tipped her over, but ultimately it was the decisions of her campaign that allowed <em>Donald Trump</em> to be within spitting distance of her at all.

Shattered lays a lot of blame for those bad decisions in the lap of Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager. Throughout the book, he's portrayed as dogmatically obsessed with data, refusing to do anything that doesn't come up as optimal in his models. It was Mook who refused to do polling (because he thought his analytics provided almost the same information at a fraction of the cost), Mook who refused to condone any attempts at persuading undecided or weak Trump voters to back Clinton, Mook who consistently denied resources to swing state team leads, and Mook who responded to Bill Clinton's worries about anti-establishment sentiment and white anger with "the data run counter to your anecdotes".

We now have a bit more context in which to view Mook's "data" and Bill's "anecdotes".

I'm a committed empiricist, but Mook's "data driven" approach made me repeatedly wince. Anything that couldn't be measured was discounted as unimportant. Anything that wasn't optimal was forbidden. And any external validation of models – say via polls – was vetoed because Mook didn't want to "waste" money validating models he was so confident in.

Mook treated the election as a simple optimization problem – he thought he knew how many votes or how much turnout was associated with every decision he could make, and he assumed that if he fed all this into computers, he'd get the definitive solution to the election.

The problem here is that elections remain unsolved. There doesn't exist an equation that lets you win an election. There's too many factors and too many unknowns and you aren't acting in a vacuum. You have an opponent who is actively countering you. And it should go almost without saying that an optimal solution to an election is only possible if the solution can be kept secret. If your opponent knows your solution, they will find a way to counter it.

Given that elections are intractable as simple optimization problems, a smart campaign will rely on experienced humans to make major decisions. Certainly, these humans should be armed with the best algorithms, projections, data, and cost-benefit analyses that a campaign can supply. But to my (outsider) eyes, it seems absolutely unconscionable to cut out the human element and ignore all of the accumulated experience a campaign brain trust can bring to bear on an election. Clinton didn't lack for a brain trust, but her brain trust certainly lacked for opportunities to make decisions.

Not all the blame can rest on Mook though. The campaign ultimately comes down to a candidate and quite frankly, there were myriad ways in which Clinton wasn't that great of a candidate.

First: vision. She didn't have one. Clinton felt at home in policy, so her campaign had a lot of it. She treated the election like a contest to create policy that would apply to the rational self-interest of a winning coalition of voters. Trump tried to create a story that would appeal to the self-conception of a winning coalition of voters.

I don't think one is necessarily superior to the other, but I've noticed that charismatic and generally liked leaders (Trudeau, Macron, Obama if we count his relatively high approval ratings at the end of his presidency) manage to combine both. Clinton was the "establishment" candidate, the candidate that was supposed to be <em>good</em> at elections. She had every opportunity to learn to use both tools. But she only ever used one, depriving her of a critical weapon against her opponent. In this way, she was a lot like Romney.

(Can you imagine Clinton vs. Romney? That would have been high comedy right there.)

After vision comes baggage. Clinton had a whole mule train of it. Her emails, her speeches, her work for the Clinton foundation – there were plenty of time bombs there. I know the standard progressive talking point is that Clinton had baggage because a woman had to be in politics as long as she did before she would be allowed to run for the presidency. And if her baggage was back room deals with foreign despots or senate subcommittees (the two generally differ only in the lavishness of the receptions they throw, not their moral character) that explanation would be all well and good.

But Clinton used a private email server because she didn't want the laws on communication disclosures apply to her. She gave paid speeches and hid the transcripts because she felt entitled to hundreds of thousands of dollars and (apparently) thought she could take the money and then remain impartial.

Both of these unforced errors showed poor judgement and entitlement. They weren't banal expressions of the compromises people need to make to govern. They showed real contempt for the electorate, in that they sought to deny voters a chance to hold Clinton <em>accountable </em>for what she said, both as the nation's top diplomat and as (perhaps only briefly) its most exorbitantly compensated public speaker.

As she was hiding things, I doubt Clinton explicitly thought "fuck the voters, I don't care what they think", it was instead probably "damned if I'm giving everyone more ammunition to get really angry about". Unfortunately, the second isn't benign in a democracy, where <em>responsible </em>government first and foremost requires politicians to be responsible to voters for <em>all </em>of their beliefs and actions, even the ones they'd rather keep out of the public eye. To allow any excuse at all to be used to escape from responsible government undermines the very idea of it.

As a personal note, I think it was stupid of Clinton to be so contemptuous because it made her long-term goals more difficult, but I also think her contempt was understandable in light of the fact that she's waded through more bullshit in the service of her country than any five other politicians combined. Politicians are humans and make mistakes and it's possible to understand and sympathize with the ways those mistakes come from human frailty while also condemning the near-term effects (lost elections) and long-term effects (decreased trust in democratic institutions) of bad decisions.

The final factor that Clinton deserves blame for is her terrible management style. When talking about management, Peter Thiel opined that only a sociopath would give two people the same job. If this is true – I'm inclined to trust him under the principle that it takes one to know one – Clinton is a sociopath. There was no clear chain of command for the campaign. At every turn, people could see their work undone by well-connected "Clinton World" insiders. The biggest miracle is that the members of the campaign managed to largely keep this on the down-low.

Clinton made much of Obama's 2008 "drama free" campaign. She wanted her 2016 campaign to run the same way. But instead of adopting the management habits that Obama used to engender loyalty, she decided that the differences lay everywhere but in the candidates; if only she had better, more loyal people working for her, she'd have the drama free campaign she desired. And so, she cleaned house, started fresh, and demanded that there would be no drama. As far as the media was concerned, there wasn't. But under the surface, things were brutal.

Mook hid information from pretty much everyone because his position felt precarious. No one told Abedin anything because they knew she'd tell it right to Clinton, especially if it wasn't complementary. Everyone was scared that their colleagues would stab them in the back to prove their loyalty to Clinton. Employees who failed were stripped of almost all responsibilities, but never fired. In 2008, fired employees 'took the axes they had to grind, sharpened them, and jammed them in Clinton's back during media interviews'. Clinton learned lessons from that, but I'm not sure if they were the right ones.

I'm not sure how much of this was text and how much was subtext, but I emerged from Shattered feeling that the blame for losing the election can't stop with the Clinton camp. There's also Bernie Sanders. I don't think anyone can blame him for talking about emails and speeches, but I've come to believe that the chip on his shoulder about the unfairness of the primary was way out of line; if anyone in the Democratic Party beat Clinton on a sense of entitlement, it was Sanders.

Politics is a team sport. You can't accomplish anything alone, so you have to rely on other people. Clinton (whatever her flaws) was reliable. She fought and she bled and she suffered for the Democratic Party. Insofar as anyone has <em>ever</em> been owed a nomination, Clinton was owed this one.

Sanders hadn't even fundraised for the party. And he expected them not to do whatever they could for Clinton? Why? He was an outsider trying to hijack their institution. His complaints would have been fair from a Democrat, but from an independent socialist?

On the Republican side, Trump had the same thing going on (and presumably would have been equally damaging to another nominee had he lost). In both cases, the party owed them nothing. It was childish of Bernie to go on like the party was supposed to be impartial.

(Also, in what meaningful ways vis a vis ability to hire staff and coordinate policy would you expect a Sanders White House to be different from the Trump White House? If you didn't answer "none", then you have some serious thinking to do.)

You'd think the effect of all of this would be for me to feel contempt for the Democratic Party in general and Clinton in particular. But aside from Sanders, I came out of it feeling really sorry for everyone involved.

I felt sorry for Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Sanders' inflammatory rhetoric necessitated throwing her under the bus right before the convention. She didn't take it gracefully, but then, how could she? She'd flown her whole family from Florida to Philadelphia to see her moment of triumph as Chairwoman of the DNC speaking at the Democratic National Convention and had it all taken away from her so that Sanders' supporters wouldn't riot (and apparently it was still a near thing). She spent the better part of the day negotiating her exit with the Clinton campaign's COO, instead of appearing on the stage like she'd hoped to. The DNC ended up footing the bill for flying her family home.

I felt sorry for Mook. He had a hard job and less power and budget than were necessary to do it well. He trusted his models too much, but this is partially because he was really good with them. Mook's math made it almost impossible for Sanders to win. Clinton had been terrible at delegate math in 2008. Mook redeemed that. To give just one example of his brilliance, he prioritized media spending in districts with an odd number of delegates, which meant that Clinton won an outside number of delegates from her wins <em>and</em> losses <a href="#shtrd-btm-1" id="shtrd-top-1">[1]</a>.

I felt sorry for the whole Clinton campaign. Things went so wrong, so often that they had a saying: "we don't get to have nice things". Media ignores four Clinton victories to focus on one of Sanders'? "We don't get to have nice things". Trump goes off the rails, but it gets overshadowed by the ancient story about emails? "We don't get to have nice things."

Several members of the campaign had their emails hacked (probably by the Russians). Instead of reporting on the Russian interference and Russian ties to the Trump campaign, the media talked about those emails over and over again in the last month of the election <a href="#shtrd-btm-2" id="shtrd-top-2">[2]</a>. That must have been maddening for the candidate and her team.

Even despite <em>that,</em> I felt sorry for the press, who by and large didn't want Trump to win, but were forced by a string of terrible incentives to consistently cover Clinton in an exceedingly damning way. If you want to see <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=meditations+on+moloch&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enCA691CA692&amp;oq=meditations+on+moloch&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.4658j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Moloch</a>'s hand at work, look no further than reporting on the 2016 election.

But most of all, I felt sorry for Clinton. Here was a woman who had spent her whole adult life in politics, largely motivated by a desire to help women and children (causes she'd been largely successful at). As Secretary of State, she flew 956,733 miles (equivalent to two round trips to the moon) and visited 112 countries. She lost two races for the presidency. And it must have been so crushing to have bled and fought and given so much, to think she'd finally succeeded, then to have it all taken away from her by Donald Trump.

Yet, she conceded anyway. She was crushed, but she ensured that America's legacy of peaceful transfers of power would continue.

November 8<sup>th</sup> may have been one of the worst nights of my life. But I'm not self-absorbed enough to think my night was even remotely as bad as Clinton's. Clinton survived the worst the world could do to her and is still breathing and still trying to figure out what to do next. If her campaign gave me little to admire, that makes up a good bit of the gap.

I really recommend Shattered for anyone who wants to see just how off the rails a political campaign can go when it's buffeted by a combination of candidate ineptitude, unclear chains of command, and persistent attacks from a foreign adversary. It's a bit repetitious at times, which was sometimes annoying and sometimes helpful (especially when I'd forgotten who was who), but otherwise grippingly and accessibly written. The fascinating subject matter more than makes up for any small burrs in the delivery.

<strong id="shtrd-btm-1">[1]</strong> In a district that has an odd number of delegates, winning by a single vote meant an extra delegate. In a district with 6 delegates, you'd get 3 delegates if you won between 50% and 67% of the votes. In a district with 7, you'd get 4 if you won by even a single vote, and five once you surpassed 71%. If a state has ten counties, four with seven delegates and six with six delegates, you can win the state by four delegates if you squeak to a win in the four districts with seven delegates and win at least 34% of the vote in each of the others. In practice, statewide delegates prevent such wonky scenarios except when the vote is really close, but this sort of math remains vital to winning a close race.  <a href="#shtrd-top-1">^</a>

<strong id="shtrd-btm-2">[2]</strong> WikiLeaks released the hacked emails a few hundred a day for the last month of the election, starting right after the release of Trump's "grab her by the pussy" video. This steady drip-drip-drip of bad press was very damaging for the Clinton campaign, especially because many people didn't differentiate this from the <em>other</em> Clinton-email story.

At this point, I want to know whether WikiLeaks is an organ of the Russian state, or just manipulated by them. Personally, I gravitate towards the first. Chelsea Manning is a hero, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/11/farage-assange-shameless-illiberal-alliance">everyone else aligned with WikiLeaks seems to hate the West so much that they'll happily climb into Putin's pocket</a> if it means they get to take a shot at it. <a href="#shtrd-top-2">^</a>
