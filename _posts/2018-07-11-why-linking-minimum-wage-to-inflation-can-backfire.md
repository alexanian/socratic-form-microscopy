Last week I explained how poor decisions by central bankers (specifically failing to spur inflation) <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2018/07/01/you-might-want-to-blame-central-banks-for-poor-wage-growth/">can make recessions much worse</a> and lead to slower wage growth during recovery.

(Briefly: inflation during recessions reduces the real cost of payroll, cutting business expenses and making firing people unnecessary. During a recovery, it makes hiring new workers cheaper and so leads to more being hired. Because central bankers failed to create inflation during and after the great recession, many businesses are scared of raising salaries. They believe (correctly) that this will increase their payroll expenses to the point where they'll have to lay many people off if another recession strikes. Until memories of the last recession fade or central bankers clean up their act, we shouldn't expect wages to rise.)

Now I'd like to expand on an offhand comment I made about the minimum wage last week and explore how it can affect recovery, especially if it's indexed to inflation.

The minimum wage represents a special case when it comes to pay cuts and layoffs in recessions. While it's always theoretically possible to convince people to take a pay cut rather than a layoff (<a href="https://www.richmondfed.org/~/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/econ_focus/2013/q1/pdf/jargon_alert.pdf">although in practice it's mostly impossible</a>), this option isn't available for people who make the minimum wage. It's illegal to pay them anything less. If bad times strike and business is imperiled, people making the minimum wage might have to be laid off.

I say "might", because when central bankers aren't proving useless, inflation can rescue people making the minimum wage from being let go. Inflation makes the minimum wage relatively less valuable, which reduces the cost of payroll relative to other inputs and helps to save jobs that pay minimum wage. This should sound familiar, because inflation helps people making the minimum wage in the exact same way it helps everyone else.

Because of increasingly expensive housing and persistently slow wage growth, some jurisdictions are experimenting with indexing the minimum wage to inflation. This means that the minimum wage rises at the same rate as the cost of living. Most notably (to me, at least), this group includes my home province of Ontario.

I think decreasing purchasing power is a serious problem (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2017/06/03/whose-minimum-wage/">especially because of its complicated intergenerational dynamics</a>), but I think this is one of the worst possible ways to deal with it.

When the minimum wage is tied to inflation, recessions can become especially dangerous and drawn out.

With the minimum wage rising in lockstep with inflation, any attempts to decrease payroll costs in real terms (that is to say: inflation adjusted terms) is futile to the extent that payroll expenses are for minimum wage workers. Worse, people who were previously making above the minimum wage and might have had their jobs saved by inflation can be swept up by an increasingly high minimum wage.

This puts central bankers in a bind. As soon as the minimum wage is indexed to inflation, inflation is no longer a boon to all workers. Suddenly, many workers can find themselves in a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" situation. Without inflation, they may be too expensive to keep. With it, they may be saved… until the minimum wage comes for them too. If a recession goes on long enough, only high-income workers would be sparred.

In addition, minimum wage (or near-minimum wage) workers who are laid off during a period of higher inflation (an in this scenario, there will be many) will suffer comparatively more, as their savings get exhausted even more quickly.

Navigating these competing needs would be an especially tough challenge for certain central banks like the US Federal Reserve – those banks that have dual mandates to maintain stable prices <em>and</em> full employment. If a significant portion of the US ever indexes its minimum wage to inflation, the Fed will have no good options.

It is perhaps darkly humorous that central banks, which bear an unusually large parcel of the blame for our current slow wage growth, stand to face the greatest challenges from the policies we're devising to make up for their past shortcomings. Unfortunately, I think a punishment of this sort is rather like cutting off our collective nose to spite our collective face.

There are simple policies we could enact to counter the risks here. Suspending any peg to inflation during years that contain recessions (in Ontario at least, the minimum wage increase due to inflation is calculated annually) would be a promising start. Wage growth after a recession could be ensured with a rebound clause, or better yet, the central bank actually doing its job properly.

I am worried about the political chances (and popularity once enacted) of any such pragmatic policy though. Many people respond to recessions with the belief that the government can make things better by passing the right legislation – forcing the economy back on track by sheer force of ink. This is rarely the case, especially because the legislation that people have historically clamoured for when unemployment is high is the sort that increases wages, not lowers them. This is a disaster when unemployment threatens because of too-high wages. FDR is remembered positively for his policy of increasing wages during the great depression, even though this <a href="https://marketmonetarist.com/2013/06/02/scott-sumner-its-complicated-the-great-depression-in-the-us/">disastrous decision strangled the recovery in its crib</a>. I don't expect any higher degree of economic literacy from people today.

To put my fears more plainly, I worry that politicians, faced with waning popularity and a nipping recession, would find allowing the minimum wage to be frozen too much of a political risk. I frankly don't trust most politicians to follow through with a freeze, even if it's direly needed.

Minimum wages are one example of a tradeoff we make <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2017/07/19/minimum-standards-or-broad-access/">between broad access and minimum standards</a>. Do we try and make sure everyone who wants a job can have one, or do we make sure people who have jobs aren't paid too little for their labour, even if that hurts the unemployed? As long as there's scarcity, we're going to have to struggle with how we ensure that as many people as possible have their material needs met and that involves tradeoffs like this one.

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2018/02/09/cities-are-weird-and-minimum-wages-can-help/">Minimum wages</a> are just one way we can do this. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2017/08/27/why-dont-we-subsidize-higher-wages-or-public-policy-is-expensive/">Wage subsidies</a> or a <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/16/basic-income-not-basic-jobs-against-hijacking-utopia/">Universal Basic Income</a> are both being discussed with increasing frequency these days.

But when we're making these kind of compassionate decisions, we need to look at the risks of whatever systems we choose. Proponents of indexing the minimum wage to inflation haven't done a good job of understanding the grave risk it poses to the health of our economy and perhaps most of all, to the very people they seek to help. In places like Ontario, where the minimum wage is already indexed to inflation, we're going to pay for their lack of foresight next time an economic disaster strikes.
