</ol>
<h2>Notes</h2>
I thought that making my predictions mostly numerical would make them easy to grade. This mostly worked, but there were a few edge cases, judgement calls, and other amusing things that I want to explicitly mention:
<ul>
 	<li>Throughout my predictions I used the word "remains". I regret this, because it is ambiguous. I think I intended it to mean "on January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2018, X remains true", but there's an alternative parsing that is "during all of 2017, X will be true". I feel it's most accurate to grade these according to my intent. For my 2018 predictions, I will use clearly language.</li>
 	<li>For <strong>8</strong>, the two most recent polls I could find were both from November. In one, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bjx7TNhWA6P4WRzkJ6pccgTWjmoBR8Ob/view">Patrick Brown had a "don't know" rating of 50%</a>. <a href="http://poll.forumresearch.com/data/cb46b6d8-2e86-4df0-a77f-ae00466193d0FOLS%20Horserace%20Nov.pdf">In the other, it was 34%</a>. Polls were found by Googling 'ontario leader popularity' and 'ontario leader popularity politics'; November was the last month in which I could find polls, so I only used November polls. I'm averaging these two and considering the prediction successful. The lack of good aggregation of Ontario political information is part of why I would like to create a website tracking the Ontario election this year.</li>
 	<li>While I was correct as to the who wasn't the next leader of the Conservative party, I definitely got emotionally involved such that I was severely miscalibrated. Bernier came far closer to winning it then Leitch or Chong and both of those two fringe candidates had much lower chances that it <em>felt</em> like they did.</li>
 	<li>WRT <strong>24 </strong>and <strong>25</strong>, I'm not counting the Las Vegas shooting as a terrorist attack because it lacked a political motive (as far as we currently know). I think I overestimated the risk of terrorist attack because of the availability heuristic (the last two years had seen a higher than normal amount of successful and dangerous terrorist attacks). A proper estimation would have focused more on the base rate.</li>
 	<li>I don't think Trump's cancellation of advertising comes anywhere close to fulfilling <strong>29</strong>, so I'm marking it as failed.</li>
 	<li><strong>31</strong> is borderline, with many former FARC fighters "<a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20171124-colombia-peace-deal-juan-manuel-santos-farc-one-year-anniversary">joining criminal gangs or a dissident FARC movement that has about 1,000 fighters nationwide</a>". Given that this still implies less than 1000 members rearmed to continue the fight as FARC, I think the prediction holds.</li>
 	<li><strong>38 </strong>is also borderline, but ultimately, I think there is a difference between an announcement of intent to move and an actual movement. Since I was going to mark <strong>28</strong> as a success if Trump hadn't signed the tax bill by now, it's only fair that I mark <strong>38</strong> as a failure.</li>
 	<li>I was <strong>way</strong> under-confident in the stability of the Mosul dam (<strong>41</strong>). Compare my probability with<a href="https://goodjudgment.com/superforecasting/index.php/2017/01/26/forecasting-the-future-of-the-mosul-dam/"> the chance on the Good Judgement Project</a> and you'll see I really overstated the risk compared to the consensus.</li>
 	<li>WRT to <strong>43 </strong>and <strong>44</strong>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2017/07/iran-sanctions/534003/">the US Treasury added new groups to existing designations</a>, but these are neither new sanctions, nor international sanctions</li>
 	<li>For <strong>59</strong>, I <em>think</em> this Daily Mail headline counts: "<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5025115/Thai-King-brought-mistress-father-s-cremation.html">Thailand's colourful new King brought 'his mistress AND his former air stewardess wife' to his father's lavish cremation ceremony with both marching in bearskin hats</a>". I think I want to stay away from prediction "scandals" in the future though, because it's a very fuzzy concept.</li>
 	<li>While North Korea claims to have a complete, miniaturized ICBM, it looks like them actually realizing this with <a href="http://www.38north.org/2017/11/melleman112917/">a weapon able to hit the US mainland</a> is about one year away. Therefore <strong>66</strong> is a success.</li>
 	<li><strong>69 </strong>is only <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-gdp-preliminary/russias-economic-recovery-slows-gdp-up-1-8-percent-year-on-year-in-third-quarter-idUSKBN1DD1SO">provisionally true</a> and needs to be revised when more GDP data is available.</li>
 	<li>I am apparently rubbish at predicting snap elections, given that I got both <strong>77 </strong>and <strong>58</strong> wrong, while being highly confident in my wrongness.</li>
 	<li>Out of all of my failed predictions, the one that surprised me the most was the OPEC deal holding. I really thought that it would fall apart.</li>
</ul>
A complete list of the sources I used when grading all non-personal predictions is available <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/rw90l3zbxu3rlg6/2017%20Links.docx?dl=0">here</a>.
<h2>Calibration</h2>
The whole point of having predictions with few allowed probabilities (for me it was 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% and 90%) is that you can then check how accurate these were by pooling your answers. Here's how I did:

Of my predictions at a <strong>50%</strong> confidence level, I got <strong>7</strong> right and <strong>6</strong> wrong (<strong>54%</strong>).
Of my predictions at a <strong>60%</strong> confidence level, I got <strong>9</strong> right and <strong>4</strong> wrong (<strong>69%</strong>).
Of my predictions at a <strong>70%</strong> confidence level, I got <strong>16</strong> right and <strong>4</strong> wrong (<strong>80%</strong>).
Of my predictions at an <strong>80%</strong> confidence level, I got <strong>20</strong> right and <strong>6</strong> wrong (<strong>77%</strong>).
Of my predictions at a <strong>90%</strong> confidence level, I got <strong>17</strong> right and <strong>2</strong> wrong (<strong>89%</strong>).

If you prefer graphs, here's the results on a graph. The red line shows what I would get if I was a perfect judge of probability. The blue line is actual me. Whenever the red line is below my results, I was under-confident. Whenever it's above them, I was overconfident.

<img class="size-medium_large wp-image-652 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/wp-content/uploads/Calibration-1-768x768.png" alt="" width="768" height="768" />

I'm pleased that in general (excepting 70% vs. 80%), things I thought were more likely were in fact more likely. I appear to be fairly under-confident at lower probability levels (50% through 70%), and fairly good at higher confidence levels (80% and 90%), although of course this is just one year and some of this could be due to chance and luck.

My meta-calibration was quite poor. I was never more than 10% off from perfect calibration, despite my worries that I would frequently be up to 15% from it.
