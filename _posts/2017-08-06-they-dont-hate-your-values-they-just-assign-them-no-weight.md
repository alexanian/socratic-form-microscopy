Content Warning: Extensive discussion of the morality of abortion

</p>

Previously, I talked about akrasia as <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2017/07/30/socially-conservative-legislation-as-akrasia-managment/">one motive for socially conservative legislation</a>. I think the akrasia model is useful when explaining certain classes of seemingly hypocritical behaviour, but it's far from the only reason for social conservatives to push for legislation that liberals oppose. At least <em>some</em> legislation comes from a desire to force socially conservative values on everyone[^1].

Liberals are <em>terrible</em> at understanding the values underlying conservative legislation. When <a href="http://thefederalist.com/2017/05/25/5-things-right-can-learn-abortion-supporters-yale-law/">an anti-abortion single issue voter took a reproductive rights seminar at Yale</a>, he was surprised to hear that many of his classmates believed that anti-abortion laws were aimed entirely at controlling women's sexuality, rather than stopping the (to his eyes) moral crime of abortion[^2].

This is an easy mistake to make. It's true that limiting abortion also limits women's financial and sexual freedom. In the vast majority of cases it's false to claim that this is a plus for the most vociferous opponents of abortion. To their detriment it also isn't a <em>minus</em>. For many of the staunchest opponents of abortion, the financial or sexual freedom of women plays no role at all in their position. Held against the life of a fetus, these freedoms are (morally) worthless.

People opposed to abortion who also value these things tend to take more moderate positions. For them, their stance on abortion is a trade-off between two valuable things (the life of a fetus and the freedoms of the mother). I know some younger Catholics who fall into this category. Then tend to be of the position that things that reduce abortion (like sexual education, free prenatal care, free daycare, and contraceptive use) are all very good, but they rarely advocate for the complete abolition of abortion (except by restructuring society such that no woman feels the need for one).

Total opposition to abortion is only possible when you hold the benefits of abortion as far less morally relevant than the costs. Total support likewise. If I viewed a fetus to be as morally relevant as a born person, I could not support abortion rights to the extent I do.

The equation <em>views my values as morally meaningless + argues strongly for things that would hurt those values</em> can very easily appear to come out to <em>holds the opposite of my values</em>. But this doesn't have to be the case! Most anti-abortion advocates aren't trying to paper over women's sexual freedoms (with abortion laws). Most abortion supporters aren't reveling in the termination of pregnancies.

This mistake is especially easy to make because you have every incentive to caricature your political enemies. It's especially pernicious though, because it makes it so hard to productively talk about any area where you disagree. You and your opponents both think that you are utterly opposed and for either to triumph, the other must lose. It's only when you see that your values are orthogonal, not opposed that you have any hope for compromise.

I think the benefits of this model lie primarily in sympathy and empathy. Understanding that anti-abortion advocates aren't literally trying to reduce the financial security and sexual freedom of women doesn't change the fact that their policies have the practical effects of accomplishing these things. I'm still going to oppose them on the grounds of the consequences of their actions, even if I no longer believe that they're at all motivated by <em>those specific consequences</em>.

But empathy isn't useless! There's something to be said for the productivity of a dialogue when you don't believe that the other side hates everything about your values! You can try and find common values and make compromises based on those. You can convince people more effectively when you accurately understand their beliefs and values. These can be instrumentally useful when trying to convince people of your point or when advocating for your preferred laws.

Abortion gave me the clearest example of orthogonal values, but it might actually be the hardest place to find any compromise. Strongly held orthogonal values can still lead to gridlock. If not abortion, where is mutually beneficial compromise possible? Where else do liberals argue with only a caricature of their opponents' values?

[^1]: Socially liberal legislation is just <em>objectively</em> right and is based on the values everyone <em>would</em> have if they could choose freely. Only my political enemies try and <em>force</em> anything on anyone. /sarcasm
[^2]: People who aren't women can also have abortions and their ability to express their sexualities is also controlled by laws limiting access to abortion. If there exists a less awkward construction than "anyone with a uterus" that I can use instead of "women", I'd be delighted to find it.
