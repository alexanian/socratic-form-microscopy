<a href="https://medium.com/@yonatanzunger/trial-balloon-for-a-coup-e024990891d5#.63vy7pfkt">Yonatan Zunger has an article in Medium</a> claiming that the immigration executive order from last Friday is the "trial balloon" for a planned Trump coup. I don't think this is quite correct. While I no longer have much confidence that America will still be a democracy in 50 years, I don't think Trump will be its first dictator.

I do think the first five points in Dr. Zunger's analysis are fairly sound. I'm not sure if they are true, but they're certainly plausible. It is true, for example, that it is unusual to file papers for re-election so quickly. Barack Obama didn't file his re-election form <a href="http://www.fec.gov/press/press2011/presidential_form2nm.shtml">until 2011</a>. Whether this means that Trump will use campaign donations to enrich his family remains to be seen, but the necessary public disclosures of campaign expenses make this falsifiable. Give it a year and we'll know.

Unfortunately, the 6th point is much more speculative. Dr. Zunger believes that it is likely that Trump received a large share in the Russian gas giant Rosneft in payment for winning the election and (presumably) lifting Russian sanctions in the future. Dr. Zunger relies on a recently announced and difficult to trace sale of 19.5% of Rosneft, which is close to the 19% claimed in the Steele papers (which should be the first red flag). But the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-rosneft-privatisation-insight-idUSKBN1582OH">AP article he links</a> sheds some serious doubt on this claim. It makes it clear that it isn't the whole 19.5%, €10 billion stake in Rosneft that has disappeared, only a "small" €2 billion portion of it. Between this contradiction and the inherent unreliability of the Steele papers, I'm disinclined to believe that this represents a real transfer of wealth from Russia to Trump <em id="b1"><a href="#1">[1]</a></em>.

This point, although relatively minor, represents an inflection point in Dr. Zunger's post, where it shifts from insightful analysis to shaky speculation.

As Dr. Zunger goes into more detail on Trump's supposed next step, incongruities pile up.

If Trump is planning a coup and building a parallel power structure, why did he pick General Mattis as his SecDef? The military is one of the most <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/1597/confidence-institutions.aspx">popular institutions in America</a>. The military was more popular than the presidency, even when the relatively popular Obama was president. You better bet it's more popular than Trump. This gives the military moral, as well as practical authority to stop any Trump coup.  Given that there's no way that Trump will be more popular with the soldiers and officers who actually make up the army than Gen. Mattis is, he's in an excellent position to shut down any coup attempt cold.

Gen. Mattis <em>could</em> stop a coup, but it's his character that suggests he <em>would</em>. He has a backbone made of solid steel and seems to be far more loyal to <em>America</em> than he is to the president. See as evidence his phone calls to <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/23/mattis-support-nato/96971878/">NATO members</a> and <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/01/12/splitting-from-trump-defense-pick-mattis-slams-russia-supports-iran-deal/">support for maintaining the Iran deal</a>.

The DHS isn't plausible as a parallel power structure. Sure, 45,000 employees sounds like a lot, until you realize that the total staff of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department">NYPD</a> is almost 50,000. Even in a scenario where the army stays neutral, the DHS would be hard pressed to police New York, let alone the whole country.

I also don't think preparation for a coup is the only reason to ignore court orders. In Canada, we saw the Prime Minister routinely oppose the courts, culminating with a <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2014/07/25/chief_justice_cleared_in_spat_with_stephen_harper_government.html">nasty series of public barbs directed at the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court</a>. This wasn't a prelude to Mr. Harper trying to seize power. It was the natural result of a perennially besieged and unpopular head of government fighting to pass an agenda despite heavy opposition from most civil society groups. I would contend that the proper yardstick to measure Trump against here is FDR. If Trump goes <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/when-franklin-roosevelt-clashed-with-the-supreme-court-and-lost-78497994/?page=2">beyond what FDR did</a>, we'll have cause to worry.

All this is to say, if Trump is planning a coup, he isn't being very strategic about it. That said, if he found some way to ditch General Mattis for someone more compliant, I would take the possibility of a coup much more seriously.

Image Credit: Carole Raddato</a>[/caption]Instead of viewing Trump as a Caesar-in-waiting, we should think of him as analogous to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Marius">Gaius Marius</a>. Marius never seized power, but he did violate basically every conventional norm of Roman government (he held an unprecedented 7 consulships and began the privatization of the legions). Gaius Marius made the rise of dictators almost inevitable, but he was not himself a dictator.

Like America, Rome in the 1st century BCE found itself overextended, governing and protecting a large network of tributary states and outright colonies. The Roman constitutional framework couldn't really handle administration on this scale. While year long terms are a sensible way to run a city state, they don't work with a continent-spanning empire.

In addition to the short institutional memory and lack of institutional expertise that strict term limits guaranteed, Rome ran up against a system of checks and balances that made it incredibly hard to get anything done  <em id="b2"><a href="#2">[2]</a></em>.

Today, America is running up against an archaic system of checks and balances <em id="b3"><a href="#3">[3]</a></em>. America has fallen to "<a href="http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/kludgeocracy-in-america">government by kluge</a>", a state of affairs that has seriously degraded <a href="http://induecourse.ca/thoughts-on-president-trump/">output legitimacy</a>. From Prof. Joseph Heath on Donald Trump:

<blockquote>In response to the impossibility of reform, the American system has slowly evolved into what Steven Teles calls a kludgeocracy. Rather than enacting reforms, people have found “work-arounds” to the existing system, ways of getting things done that twist the rules a bit, but that everyone accepts because it’s easier than trying to change the rules. (This is why, incidentally, those who hope that the “separation of powers” will constrain President Trump are kidding themselves – the separation of powers in the U.S. is severely degraded, as an accumulated effect of decades of “work arounds” or kludges that violate it.)

Because of this, the U.S. government suffers a massive shortfall in “output legitimacy,” in that it consistently fails to deliver anything like the levels of competent performance than people in wealthy, advanced societies expect from government. (Anyone who has ever dealt with the U.S. government knows that it is uniquely horrible experience, unlike anything suffered by citizens of other Western democracies.) Furthermore, because of the dysfunctional legislative branch, nothing ever gets “solved” to anyone’s satisfaction. All that Americans ever get is a slow accumulation of more kludges (e.g. the Affordable Care Act, the Clean Power Plan).

Most people, however, do not think institutionally. When they see bad performance from government, they blame the actors that they see readily at hand. And their response then is to send in new people, committed to changing things. For decades they’ve been doing this, and yet nothing ever changes. Why? Because the problems are institutional, outside the control of individual legislators. But how do people interpret this lack of change? Many come to the conclusion that the person they sent in to fix things got coopted, or wasn’t tough enough, or wasn’t up to the job. And so they send in someone tougher, more radical, more vociferous in his or her commitment to changing things. When that doesn’t work out, they send in someone even more radical.

A vote for Donald Trump is a natural end-point of this process.</blockquote>
For Rome, Marius was the end-point. He held more power, for longer, than anyone who came before. The crucial distinction between him and those who came after, however, was that he acquired this power through legitimate means. Still, in order to govern effectively, he was forced to apply more kluges to the already disintegrating Roman constitution. It couldn't hold up.

The end result of Marius was Sulla, who tried to bring Rome back to its "old ways" and repair the damage to the constitution. Interestingly, he did this almost entirely through extra-constitutional means. His reforms failed, although not just because of how he did them. Sulla tried to remove the kluges from the underlying system, but the result was an even more unworkable system.

Sulla was followed by the Triumvirate, a private power sharing agreement that divided up the empire and allowed effective governance at the cost of the constitution. The triumvirate led to civil war and dictatorship. And a bureaucracy capable of running the empire.

Looking back at history, I see three ways forward for America:

<ol>
 	<li>It can slowly become an autocracy, which will break the gridlock in Washington at the cost of democracy.</li>
 	<li>It can abandon its role as the world's hegemon, retreat to isolationism, and see if its government is capable of handling the strain of this reduced burden.</li>
 	<li>It can radically change its system of government. A parliamentary system (whether first past the post or mixed member proportional) based on the confidence of the house would probably prove much more responsive to the crises America faces.</li>
</ol>
I no longer believe in the great man theory of history. Instead, I've begun to see history as a series of feedback loops between people, institutions, and places. Geopolitical realities can exert as much pressure for change on institutions as people can.

If we didn't have Trump this year, we'd have someone like him in four years or eight. The stresses on the American system of government are such that someone had to emerge as the "natural endpoint" of failed reform. But I don't think it's this person's fate to become America's first dictator. That part is reserved for a later actor and there is still hope that the role can be written out before they step onto the stage.
