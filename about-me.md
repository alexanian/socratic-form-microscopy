Regular blogger, sometimes aspiring author. By day, I'm a Software Developer at <a href="http://alertlabs.com">Alert Labs</a>. By night I write things. Both of these look the exact same to an outside observer, because it's just me sitting in front of a computer screen, hitting buttons.

Posts that make falsifiable statements about how the world <em>is</em> are tagged "falsifiable". Posts that suggest ways of viewing the world are tagged "model". Posts that deal with how I think the world <em>should be</em> are tagged "ethics". Fiction is collected separately, or tagged "Austrian economics".

This blog is mostly written from an empirically minded centre-left position, with special emphasis on the role that genuine trade-offs play in political theory. If you're interested in the top level political views that shape how I write, you can look at my yearly political views posts, collected under the "<a href="/tag/my-biases/">My Biases</a>" tag.
